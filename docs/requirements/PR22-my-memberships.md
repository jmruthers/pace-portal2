# PR22 — My Memberships

## Filename convention

This file is **`PR22-my-memberships.md`** — portal requirement slice **PR22** (see [portal-project-brief.md](./portal-project-brief.md)).

---

## Overview

- **Purpose and scope:** define the `/my-memberships` route as the member's primary surface for viewing organisation membership state and submitting new join or transfer requests. This slice covers the membership list and state display, the join/transfer flow (org search → membership type → org signup form → submission → confirmation), and the empty state. It is both the destination after wizard Step 5 completion (or skip) and a standalone portal section accessible at any time.
- **Dependencies:** PR01 app shell and PR02 shared services; PR05/PR06 (wizard routes to this page after onboarding); TM01 member request architecture for all RPC contracts, data model, and pre-submission check rules; PR15/PR17 form rendering contracts for the org signup form step (org-scoped rather than event-scoped); PR07 shared person data for the profile completeness pre-submission check.
- **Standards:** 02 Architecture, 03 Security/RBAC, 04 API/Tech Stack, 05 pace-core Compliance, 07 Visual, 08 Testing/Documentation.

---

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] `/my-memberships` renders for authenticated users behind `PagePermissionGuard`.
- [x] The empty state renders when the member has no membership records, with an "Add Organisation" CTA.
- [x] Each membership renders a state card reflecting the current `core_member.membership_status` and associated `team_member_request.status` per the display rules in **Visual specification**.
- [x] The "Add Organisation" CTA launches the join/transfer flow inline on the same route.
- [x] The join/transfer flow collects: request type (Join / Transfer), org search/select, membership type (if org has >1 active type with age eligibility filtering), and the org's `org_signup` form (or a minimal no-fields view if none is configured).
- [x] Submitting the form calls `app_submit_member_request` and shows a confirmation screen on success.
- [x] Pre-submission check failures surface as inline errors without calling the RPC:
  - Profile below completeness threshold → direct user to complete their profile.
  - Duplicate pending/on-hold request for the same org → explain and block.
  - Membership type age ineligibility → block with explanation.
- [x] Transfer requests require selecting a source org (the org the member is leaving); this is shown as a step only when request type is Transfer.
- [x] The page reflects real-time state after submission: the new card appears in the list at `Awaiting approval` without requiring a page reload.
- [x] Declined memberships show an "Apply again" CTA that re-enters the join flow for the same org.
- [x] No payment or billing behaviour is introduced.

## Implementation notes (pace-portal)

- **Org signup form step:** uses shared `FormRenderer` from PR15 (pace-core `Form` + Zod schema) — the portal equivalent of PR17 `WorkflowFormRenderer`.
- **Person/member context for submit:** uses `OrganisationServiceProvider` selected org + `fetchCurrentPersonMember` fallback (per API contract “selected organisation context”).
- **Membership list:** cards are built from `core_member` rows joined to the latest `team_member_request` per member; duplicate pre-submit guard also queries person-level pending/on-hold requests via `fetchPendingMemberRequests`.
- **Post-submit list update:** optimistic `upsertListItem` + cache refetch after successful `app_submit_member_request`.
- **Org search errors:** RPC failures surface inline in the org search step (`orgSearchError` in `useMemberRequestFlow`).

---

## API / Contract

- **Public exports:** `/my-memberships`, `MyMembershipsPage`, `useMembershipList`, `useMemberRequestFlow`.
- **File paths:** `src/pages/memberships/MyMembershipsPage.tsx`, `src/hooks/memberships/useMembershipList.ts`, `src/hooks/memberships/useMemberRequestFlow.ts`.
- **Data contracts:**
  - Read: `core_member` + `team_member_request` joined by `member_id` for the current user's memberships. Use `core_member.membership_status` and `team_member_request.status` together to derive display state (see **Visual specification**).
  - Org search: type-ahead backed by **`data_pace_joinable_organisations_search`** (participant-safe directory of active tenants; avoids broad client `SELECT` on `core_organisations` under scoped RLS). Display name/id from RPC results.
  - Membership types: `core_membership_type` filtered by `organisation_id` and age eligibility against `core_person.dob`.
  - Org signup form: `core_forms` where `workflow_type = 'org_signup'` and `organisation_id` matches selected org and `status = 'published'` (DB **`form_status`** enum: `draft` / `published` / `closed`). If no matching published row exists, render no supplemental fields.
  - Submit: `app_submit_member_request` with TM01 parameters (`p_organisation_id`, `p_target_organisation_id`, `p_subject_person_id`, `p_subject_member_id`, `p_membership_type_id`, `p_form_response_id`, `p_request_type`, `p_source_organisation_id`, …) — see TM01 §5.1 and `src/lib/memberRequestRpc.ts`.
- **ID contract:** use `UserId`, `OrganisationId`, `PageId` from `@solvera/pace-core/types` at hook and service boundaries.
- **Form contract:** the org signup form step uses shared `FormRenderer` (PR15) with `useZodForm` from `@solvera/pace-core/hooks`. Org-scoped published forms use the same participant eligibility rules as PR17 (`access_mode`, `is_active`, response window) via `src/lib/orgFormEligibility.ts`.
- **Permission and context contracts:** authenticated route, `PagePermissionGuard` with `read:my-memberships`, current user/session context, and selected organisation context for the submission call.

## Visual specification

### Membership state cards

Each card represents one `core_member` record. The display state is derived from `core_member.membership_status` combined with `team_member_request.status`:

| Display state | Condition | Card content |
|---|---|---|
| **Awaiting approval** | `membership_status = Provisional` AND `request_status = pending` | Org name, submitted date, "Awaiting approval" label |
| **Under review** | `membership_status = Provisional` AND `request_status = on_hold` | Org name, "Under review" label |
| **Active** | `membership_status = Active` | Org name, member number, membership type, "Active" label |
| **Not approved** | `membership_status = Declined` | Org name, "Not approved" label, "Apply again" CTA |
| **Resigned / Revoked / Suspended / Lapsed** | Other terminal/suspended statuses | Org name, status label (human-readable); no Apply again CTA |

### Empty state

When the member has no `core_member` records: a centered empty-state panel with copy explaining they are not yet a member of any organisations, and a primary "Add Organisation" button.

### Join/transfer flow

The flow is presented as an inline step sequence within the `/my-memberships` page (not a separate route or full-page modal). The route URL does not change during the flow; the flow is driven by component state.

Steps:

1. **Request type** — Join (new member) or Transfer from another org. If Transfer, an additional "Source org" step follows org selection.
2. **Org search/select** — type-ahead querying **`data_pace_joinable_organisations_search`**. Selected org shown as a confirmation chip before proceeding.
3. **Source org** *(Transfer only)* — select the org the member is leaving from their active memberships.
4. **Membership type** *(shown when org has >1 age-eligible type, or when none are eligible)* — control group filtered by age eligibility. If exactly one eligible type exists, skip this step silently. If none are eligible, stay on this step with an inline blocking message (no submit).
5. **Org signup form** — renders the org's **published** `org_signup` form (`core_forms.status = 'published'`) via shared `FormRenderer` (PR15). Ineligible forms (inactive, wrong access mode, outside response window) are treated as not configured. If no usable form exists, shows a minimal review screen with a Submit button only.
6. **Confirmation** — "Your request has been submitted. [Org name] will be in touch." with a return-to-list action.

Pre-submission errors are shown inline before step 6 triggers the RPC.

### States

Loading (while fetching membership list), empty, list with one or more cards, flow in progress (each step), submitting (spinner on submit button), submission error (inline), confirmation screen.

---

## Verification

- Verify `/my-memberships` renders for an authenticated member with no memberships, showing the empty state and "Add Organisation" CTA.
- Verify each membership state card (Awaiting approval, Under review, Active, Not approved) renders correctly from the appropriate `core_member` / `team_member_request` data combination.
- Verify the join flow completes end-to-end: org search → membership type → form → submit → confirmation card appears in list.
- Verify a Transfer request surfaces the source org step and includes `p_source_org_id` in the RPC call.
- Verify pre-submission checks surface the correct inline error for each failure case (profile incomplete, duplicate request, age ineligibility) without calling the RPC.
- Verify a Declined membership card shows the "Apply again" CTA and that tapping it re-enters the join flow pre-populated with the same org.
- Verify the page is reachable from the wizard completion redirect (Step 5 submitted or skipped).

---

## Testing requirements

- **Required automated coverage:** membership list rendering by status, empty state, join flow step sequencing, transfer flow source-org step visibility, pre-submission guard failures (all three cases), RPC call shape on submit, confirmation state after success, "Apply again" re-entry.
- **Required scenarios:** member with no memberships, member with one active membership, member with a pending request, member with a declined membership, transfer request end-to-end, org with no `org_signup` form configured, org with multiple membership types (age eligible and ineligible), submit failure from RPC.

---

## Slice boundaries

- **PR22** owns `/my-memberships`, the membership state list, and the join/transfer flow shell.
- **TM01** owns all RPC contracts (`app_submit_member_request`, `app_resolve_member_request`), the `team_member_request` data model, and the `core_member` status enum. This slice consumes those contracts; it does not redefine them.
- **PR15** owns authenticated dynamic form rendering (`FormRenderer`); **PR17** owns the journey shell for `/forms/:slug`. This slice uses PR15 `FormRenderer` for the inline org signup step and shares org-form eligibility with PR17 via `orgFormEligibility.ts`.
- **PR05/PR06** own the wizard that routes to this page after onboarding. The wizard's Step 5 (`OrgMemberRequestSection`) is the entry-point component for a first request; subsequent requests are managed here.
- **PR07** owns member profile data used by the profile completeness pre-submission check.

---

## Do not

- Do not re-implement dynamic form rendering — use shared `FormRenderer` from PR15 (same field pipeline as PR17 journey forms).
- Do not write directly to `core_member` — all membership creation goes via `app_submit_member_request`.
- Do not use legacy `membership_status` values (e.g. do not create `core_member` records with statuses other than `Provisional` from this surface).
- Do not expose `team_member_request.review_notes` to the member — these are internal admin notes only.
- Do not add billing, payment, or joining-fee behaviour (Phase 2 per TM01 §11).
- Do not implement multi-step approval chains (Phase 2 per TM01 §11).
- Do not change the route URL during the join/transfer flow steps — the flow is inline state, not separate routes.
